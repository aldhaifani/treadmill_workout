## Overview

Ever been on the treadmill, chasing the perfect interval run? I love the challenge of adjusting incline and speed, but it quickly turns into a mental maze. Tracking time becomes a workout of its own. Enter my antidote: a sleek Flask app. No need for expensive subscriptionsâ€”this app does the trick, showing off the essentials: time, incline percentage, and speed. Say goodbye to the mental gymnastics, and hello to a seamless interval run experience!
